## Homework Assignment #4: Functions


Details:
 
Let's go back to your syllogism (logical argument) examples from Homework #3. Now it's time to turn those loose bits of logic into functions. Rather than having procedure that demonstrates that Socrates is mortal, you should create a function that accepts a name and returns a boolean (True or False) representing whether that name identifies a man who is mortal or not. Your function to gracefully handle unexpected inputs (such as an unrecognized name or a name that is a not a string at all) without throwing an exception.
